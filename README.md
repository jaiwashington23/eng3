## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.
The purpose of this assignment is to improve onshape skills.
### Evidence

Take several cropped screenshots of your Onshape document from different angles. Try to capture all important aspects of the design. Turn off overlays that obscure the parts, such as planes or mate connectors. Your images should have captions, so the reader knows what they are looking at!

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on the knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
tey way I tried to do it at first was wrong.
the challenging part was geting to the right mass. I figured it out by asking for help.
I learned that shortcuts are not the way.
I wish the measurements were more clear.

### Description & Code Snippets
Assignment: Get an RGB LED to cycle through a bunch of colors, but prettily. It should gradually shift colors, cycling through the entire rainbow. We ended up using an example neopixel code from "the complete Adafruit Library" and loading that after changing a few things, such as how fast it goes through the cycle.

```python

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(PIN, NUMPIXELS, brightness=BRIGHTNESS, auto_write=False)\
def rainbow_cycle(wait):
    for color in range(255):
        for pixel in range(len(pixels)):  # pylint: disable=consider-using-enumerate
            pixel_index = (pixel * 256 // len(pixels)) + color * 5
            pixels[pixel] = colorwheel(pixel_index & 255)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)
while True:
    rainbow_cycle(SPEED)
```

### Wiring
We literally had no wiring. The neopixel is directly attached to the board, so all we had to do was plug in the board

### Reflection
This was, at first, a confusing assignment. With no prior knowledge of any code of any sort, I was really confused. I spent the first two days just staring at the computer and doing nothing. Finally, I jumped right in. I spent about a whole day just googling up random commands before we got the wise advice to just find an example code. So that is precisely what we did. We used a random code example labeled something along the lines of "neopixel rainbow test" from "the complete Adafruit Library". All that we had to do was press run. It happened to be perfect, all we  had to do was adjust a few  lines of  code and it  ran perfectly.

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**
